A collection of real-world cloud scenarios that help you learn by solving practical, hands-on projects.

🌐 **[Visit the Website →](https://cloudchallenges.hyperoot.dev)**

## What is Cloud Challenges?

Cloud Challenges provides practical problem statements designed to build real cloud skills. Each challenge includes:

- **Clear scenario** - Real-world context and requirements
- **Architecture guidance** - Visual diagrams and component breakdowns
- **Starter code** - Boilerplate to get you started quickly
- **Solution walkthroughs** - Detailed explanations when you need help

## Why?

Most cloud tutorials walk you through step-by-step. Cloud Challenges takes a different approach - you're given a problem to solve, not a script to follow. This builds the problem-solving skills that matter in real projects.
