This short challenge introduces AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). You'll create a user, a group, and attach a simple policy.

## Objectives

- Create an IAM user
- Create an IAM group
- Attach a managed policy to the group
- Add the user to the group

## Steps

1. Open the AWS Console and navigate to IAM.
2. Create a new group called `developers`.
3. Create a new user called `challenge-user` with programmatic access.
4. Attach the managed policy `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` to the `developers` group.
5. Add `challenge-user` to the `developers` group.

## Quick CLI example

Use the AWS CLI to create a user and add it to a group:

```bash
aws iam create-user --user-name challenge-user
aws iam create-group --group-name developers
aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name developers --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name challenge-user --group-name developers
```

## Notes

- This challenge is safe to complete in your own AWS account. Be sure to clean up resources when finished.
- For an automated starter, see the `starter_repo` link in the frontmatter.
