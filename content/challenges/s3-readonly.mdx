## S3 Read-Only Listing

This short challenge shows how to grant read-only access to S3 buckets using an IAM policy.

### Steps

1. Create a policy that allows `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` on the bucket ARN.
2. Attach the policy to a group and add a user to that group.

### CLI Example

```bash
aws iam create-policy --policy-name S3ReadOnly --policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Action":["s3:ListBucket","s3:GetObject"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket","arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"]}]}'
```

Good for testing your filters — this challenge uses `providers: ["aws"]`, `services: ["s3"]`, and the `storage` tag.
